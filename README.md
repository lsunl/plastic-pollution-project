# plastic-pollution-project

Project Goals:
Illustrate how frequently consumers use plastic
Identify the toxic chemicals used to create plastic products
Look at plastic production, distribution, waste, recycled waste, mismanaged waste
Visualize the plastic industry’s fiscal value, manufacturing locations, and distribution 
Visualize countries that demand high frequency of single-use plastic products
Visualize where plastic waste accumulates by size and weight

Value:
Gain insight on the movement of plastic to bring awareness on the issue

What I know:
Plastic is not biodegradable and ends up polluting large bodies of water or on trash islands.
Can you take multiple ecosystems on Earth, compare their change over the last 50 years and see a change in the reporting topics increasingly reporting on human made materials negatively impacting all aspects of living things staying alive.

Questions we want to answer:
Which countries make, buy, and import plastic?
Where is new plastic sold to?
Which products are made with plastic?
How much does global waste contribute to climate change?

How are plastics being used?
What is the lifespan of plastic?
Where does plastic waste go?

Which countries buy the most plastic?
How much of it gets recycled?
How is plastic waste disrupting the environment?

Project requirements:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction
(e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes)
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
