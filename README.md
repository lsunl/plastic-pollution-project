# world wide waste
We've analyzed and visualized the flow of plastic pollution at a global level using HTML/CSS, Python & Flask and SQLite.

## Requirements
This application requires Python 3.6

## Access the project
1. Clone this repo
2. Launch the application with
```
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

or 

```
python app.py
```




## Project Goal:
Visualize plastic production, distribution, waste, recycled waste, mismanaged waste of countries


## Reference for Data on Plastic Waste

**Waste Generation – All Waste**
Solid waste generation rates estimate the amount of waste created by residences or businesses over a certain amount of time (day, year, etc.). Waste generation includes all materials discarded, whether or not they are later recycled or disposed in a landfill.

**Plastic in Waste Stream**
Plastic portion of entire waste stream. A waste stream is the complete flow of waste from domestic or industrial areas through to final disposal

**Inadequately Managed Waste – All Waste**
Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Inadequately managed waste has high risk of polluting rivers and oceans. 

**Waste management (or waste disposal)** are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1]This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.  This does not include 'littered' plastic waste, which is approximately 2% of total waste (including high-income
countries).

**Littered Waste – All Waste**
Litter consists of waste products that have been disposed of improperly, without consent, at an undesirable location

**Plastic Waste Generation – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic

**Inadequately Managed Plastic Waste – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic 

**Plastic waste littered – Only Plastic**
Same as above but only plastic 

**Mismanaged Plastic Waste 2010 – Only Plastic**
Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed and littered waste are different, and are defined in the sections below.

**Mismanaged Plastic Waste in 2025 – Only Plastic** 
Mismanaged waste is material which is at high risk of entering the ocean via wind or tidal transport, or carried to coastlines from inland waterways. Mismanaged waste is the sum of material which is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed and littered waste are different, and are defined in the sections below.
